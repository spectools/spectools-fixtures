        This document defines APIs for a database of records holding simple values
        and hierarchical objects. Each record consists of a key and some value.
        Moreover, the database maintains indexes over records it stores. An
        application developer directly uses an API to locate records either by
        their key or by using an index. A query language can be layered on this
        API. An indexed database can be implemented using a persistent B-tree data
        structure.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>


      <p>
        User agents need to store large numbers of objects locally in
        order to satisfy off-line data requirements of Web applications.
        [[WEBSTORAGE]] is useful for
        storing pairs of keys and their corresponding values. However, it does
        not provide in-order retrieval of keys, efficient searching over
        values, or storage of duplicate values for a key.
      </p>

      <p>
        This specification provides a concrete API to perform advanced key-value data management
        that is at the heart of most sophisticated query processors. It does
        so by using transactional databases to store keys and their
        corresponding values (one or more per key), and providing a means
        of traversing keys in a deterministic order. This is often implemented
        through the use of persistent B-tree data structures that are considered
        efficient for insertion and deletion as well as in-order traversal of
        very large numbers of data records.
      </p>

      <aside class="example">
          <p>
              In the following example, the API is used to access a "library"
              database that holds books stored by their "isbn" attribute. Additionally,
              an index is maintained on the "title" attribute of the objects
              stored in the object store. This index can be used to look up books
              by title, and enforces a uniqueness constraint. Another index is
              maintained on the "author" attribute of the objects, and can be used
              to look up books by author.
          </p>
          <p>
              A connection to the database is opened. If the "library" database
              did not already exist, it is created and an event handler creates
              the object store and indexes. Finally, the opened connection is
              saved for use in subsequent examples.
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight">
var request = indexedDB.open("library");

request.onupgradeneeded = function() {
  // The database did not previously exist, so create object stores and indexes.
  var db = request.result;
  var store = db.createObjectStore("books", {keyPath: "isbn"});
  var titleIndex = store.createIndex("by_title", "title", {unique: true});
  var authorIndex = store.createIndex("by_author", "author");

  // Populate with initial data.
  store.put({title: "Quarry Memories", author: "Fred", isbn: 123456});
  store.put({title: "Water Buffaloes", author: "Fred", isbn: 234567});
  store.put({title: "Bedrock Nights", author: "Barney", isbn: 345678});
};

request.onsuccess = function() {
  db = request.result;
};
          </pre>

          <p>
              The following example populates the
              database using a transaction.
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight">
var tx = db.transaction("books", "readwrite");
var store = tx.objectStore("books");

store.put({title: "Quarry Memories", author: "Fred", isbn: 123456});
store.put({title: "Water Buffaloes", author: "Fred", isbn: 234567});
store.put({title: "Bedrock Nights", author: "Barney", isbn: 345678});

tx.oncomplete = function() {
  // All requests have succeeded and the transaction has committed.
};
          </pre>

          <p>
              The following example looks up a single book in the database
              by title using an index.
          </p>
        <pre class="example highlight">
var tx = db.transaction("books", "readonly");
var store = tx.objectStore("books");
var index = store.index("by_title");

var request = index.get("Bedrock Nights");
request.onsuccess = function() {
  var matching = request.result;
  if (matching !== undefined) {
    // A match was found.
    report(matching.isbn, matching.title, matching.author);
  } else {
    // No match was found.
    report(null);
  }
};
        </pre>

          <p>
              The following example looks up all books
              in the database by author using an index and a cursor.
          </p>
        <pre class="example highlight">
var tx = db.transaction("books", "readonly");
var store = tx.objectStore("books");
var index = store.index("by_author");

var request = index.openCursor(IDBKeyRange.only("Fred"));
request.onsuccess = function() {
  var cursor = request.result;
  if (cursor) {
    // Called for each matching record.
    report(cursor.value.isbn, cursor.value.title, cursor.value.author);
    cursor.continue();
  } else {
    // No more matching records.
    report(null);
  }
};
        </pre>

          <p>
              The following example shows how errors could be handled when
              a request fails.
          </p>
        <pre class="example highlight">
var tx = db.transaction("books", "readwrite");
var store = tx.objectStore("books");
var request = store.put({title: "Water Buffaloes", author: "Slate", isbn: 987654});
request.onerror = function() {
  // The uniqueness constraint of the "by_title" index failed.
  report(request.error);
  // Could call request.preventDefault() to prevent the transaction from aborting.
};
tx.onabort = function() {
  // Otherwise the transaction will automatically abort due the failed request.
  report(tx.error);
};
        </pre>

          <p>
              The database connection may be closed when it is no longer needed.
          </p>
        <pre class="example highlight">
db.close();
        </pre>

        <p>
            In the future, the database may have grown to contain other object
            stores and indexes. The following example shows one way to handle
            opening an older version of the database.
        </p>

          <pre class="example highlight">
var request = indexedDB.open("library", 3); // Request version 3.

request.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
  var db = request.result;
  if (event.oldVersion &lt; 1) {
    // Version 1 is the first version of the database.
    var store = db.createObjectStore("books", {keyPath: "isbn"});
    var titleIndex = store.createIndex("by_title", "title", {unique: true});
    var authorIndex = store.createIndex("by_author", "author");
  }
  if (event.oldVersion &lt; 2) {
    // Version 2 introduces a new index of books by year.
    var bookStore = request.transaction.objectStore("books");
    var yearIndex = bookStore.createIndex("by_year", "year");
  }
  if (event.oldVersion &lt; 3) {
    // Version 3 introduces a new object store for magazines with two indexes.
    var magazines = db.createObjectStore("magazines");
    var publisherIndex = magazines.createIndex("by_publisher", "publisher");
    var frequencyIndex = magazines.createIndex("by_frequency", "frequency");
  }
};

request.onsuccess = function() {
  db = request.result; // db.version will be 3.
};

            An <dfn>object store</dfn> is the primary storage mechanism for storing data in a
            <a>database</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each database has a set of <a title="object store">object stores</a>. The set of <a title="object store">object stores</a> can be changed,
            but can only be changed using a <code>"versionchange"</code> transaction, i.e. in response to a
            <code>upgradeneeded</code> event. When a new database is created it doesn't contain any <a title="object store">object stores</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The object store has a <dfn title="object store record list">list of records</dfn> which hold the
            data stored in the object store. Each <dfn>record</dfn> consists of a <a>key</a> and a <a>value</a>.
            The list is sorted according to key in ascending order. There can never be multiple records in a given object
            store with the same key.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every <a>object store</a> has a <dfn title="object store name">name</dfn>.
            The name is unique within the <a>database</a> to which it belongs. Every object store also optionally has a
            <a>key generator</a> and an optional <dfn title="object store key path">key path</dfn>.
            If the object store has a key path it is said to use <dfn>in-line keys</dfn>. Otherwise it is said to
            use <dfn>out-of-line keys</dfn>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The object store can derive the <a>key</a> from one of three sources:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A <a>key generator</a>. A key generator generates a monotonically increasing numbers every time
              a key is needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keys can be derived via a <a title="object store key path">key path</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keys can also be explicitly specified when a <a>value</a> is stored in the object store.

          <p>
            In order to efficiently retrieve <a title="record">records</a> stored in an indexed database,
            each <a>record</a> is organized according to its <dfn>key</dfn>. A value is said to be a <dfn>valid key</dfn>
            if it is one of the following ECMAScript [[!ECMA-262]] types:
            <code>Number</code> primitive value,
            <code>String</code> primitive value,
            <code>Date</code> object, or
            <code>Array</code> object.

            An <code>Array</code> is only a <a>valid key</a> if every item in the array is defined and is
            a <a>valid key</a> (i.e. sparse arrays can not be <a title="valid key">valid keys</a>) and if the <code>Array</code> doesn't directly or
            indirectly contain itself.

            Any non-numeric properties on an <code>Array</code> are ignored, and thus do not affect whether the <code>Array</code> is a <a>valid key</a>.

            If the value is of type <code>Number</code>, it is only a <a>valid key</a> if it is not <code>NaN</code>.

            If the value is of type <code>Date</code> it is only a <a>valid key</a> if its <code>[<span>[</span>PrimitiveValue]]</code>
            internal property, as defined by [[!ECMA-262]], is not <code>NaN</code>.

            <a title="conforming user agent">Conforming user agents</a> MUST support all <a title="valid key">valid keys</a> as keys.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            Infinite <code>Number</code> values are <a title="valid key">valid keys</a>. As are empty <code>Array</code>s.
          </p>

          <p>
              Operations that accept <a title="key">keys</a> MUST perform as if  each <a>key</a> parameter
              value, in order, is copied by the <a>structured clone algorithm</a> [[!HTML5]] and
              the copy is instead used as input to the operation, before proceding with rest of the operation.
          </p>

          <p class="note">
              This implicit copying step ensures that <a>key</a> values do not change after
              the operation begins, due to side effects such as ECMAScript [[!ECMA-262]] getters,
              setters and type conversion functions including <code>toString()</code> and
              <code>valueOf()</code>.
          </p>

          <p>
            For purposes of comparison, all <code>Array</code>s are greater than all <code>String</code>,
            <code>Date</code> and <code>Number</code> values; all <code>String</code> values are greater than all
            <code>Date</code> and <code>Number</code> values; and all <code>Date</code> values are greater than all
            <code>Number</code> values. Values of type <code>Number</code> are compared to other <code>Number</code> values
            numerically. Values of type <code>Date</code> are compared to other <code>Date</code> values chronologically.
            Values of type <code>String</code> are compared to other values of type <code>String</code>
            by using the algorithm defined by step 4 of <cite>section 11.8.5, The Abstract Relational Comparison Algorithm</cite>,
            of the ECMAScript Language Specification [[!ECMA-262]].
            Values of type <code>Array</code> are compared to other values of type <code>Array</code> as follows:

          <ol>
            <li>

            <li>
              If the <var>i</var>th value of <var>A</var> is <a>greater than</a> the <var>i</var>th value of
              <var>B</var>, then <var>A</var> is greater than <var>B</var>. Skip the remaining steps.
            </li>
            <li>
              Increase <var>i</var> by 1.
            </li>
            <li>
              If <var>i</var> is not equal to <var>length</var>, go back to step 4. Otherwise continue to next step.
            </li>
            <li>
              If <var>A</var>'s length is less than <var>B</var>'s length, then <var>A</var> is less
              than <var>B</var>. If <var>A</var>'s length is greater than <var>B</var>'s length, then
              <var>A</var> is greater than <var>B</var>. Otherwise <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> are equal.

          <p class="note">
            Note that <code>Array</code>s that contain other <code>Array</code>s are allowed as <a title="valid key">valid keys</a>.

            This is because an <code>Array</code> of any candidate highest <a>key</a> followed by another <a>valid key</a> is even higher.

            The following examples illustrate the different behaviors when trying to use in-line <a title="key">keys</a> and <a title="key generator">key generators</a>
            to save an object to an <a>object store</a>.
          </p>
          <aside class="example">
            <p>If the following conditions are true:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>This is the fourth entry in an <a>object store</a>.</li>
                <li>The <a>object store</a> has a <a>key generator</a>.</li>
                <li>There is no in-line value for the <a>key path</a> property.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Then the value provided by the <a>key generator</a> is used to populate the key value.
                In the example below the <a>key path</a> for the object store is <code>"foo.bar"</code>.
                The actual object has no value for the <code>bar</code> property, <code>{ foo: {} }</code>.
                When the object is saved in the <a>object store</a> the <code>bar</code> property is assigned a value of 4
                because that is the next <a>key</a> generated by the <a>object store</a>.
              </p>
            <pre class="example highlight">
 "foo.bar"
{ foo: {} }
            </pre>
            <p>If the following conditions are true:</p>
              <ul>

                <li>The <a>object store</a> has a <a>key generator</a>.</li>
                <li>There is a value for the <a>key path</a> property.</li>
              </ul>
            <p>
              Then the value associated with the <a>key path</a> property is used.
              The auto-generated <a>key</a> is not used.
              In the example below the <a>key path</a> for the <a>object store</a> is <code>"foo.bar"</code>.
              The actual object has a value of 10 for the <code>bar</code> property, <code>{ foo: { bar: 10} }</code>.
              When the object is saved in the <a>object store</a> the <code>bar</code> property keeps its value of 10, because that is the key value.
            </p>
            <pre class="example highlight">
"foo.bar"
{ foo: { bar: 10 } }
            </pre>
            <p>
              The following example illustrates the scenario when the specified in-line <a>key</a> is defined through a <a>key path</a> but there is no property matching it.
              The value provided by the <a>key generator</a> is then used to populate the key value and the system is responsible
              for creating as many properties as it requires to suffice the property dependencies on the hierarchy chain.
              In the example below the <a>key path</a> for the <a>object store</a> is <code>"foo.bar.baz"</code>.
              The actual object has no value for the <code>foo</code> property, <code>{ zip: {} }</code>.
              When the object is saved in the <a>object store</a> the <code>foo</code>, <code>bar</code>, and <code>baz</code> properties
              are created each as a child of the other until a value for <code>foo.bar.baz</code> can be assigned.
              The value for <code>foo.bar.baz</code> is the next key generated by the object store.
            </p>
            <pre class="example highlight">
"foo.bar.baz"
{ zip: {} }
            </pre>
            <p>
              Attempting to store a property on a primitive value will fail and throw an error.
              In the first example below the <a>key path</a> for the object store is <code>"foo"</code>.
              The actual object is a primitive with the value, <code>4</code>.
              Trying to define a property on that primitive value fails.
              The same is true for arrays.  Properties are not allowed on an array.
              In the second example below, the actual object is an array, <code>[10]</code>.
              Trying to define a property on the array fails.
            </p>
            <pre class="example highlight">
// The key generation will attempt to create and store the key path property on this primitive.
"foo"
4

// The key generation will attempt to create and store the key path property on this array.
"foo"

            It is sometimes useful to retrieve <a title="record">records</a> in an <a>object store</a> through other means
            than their <a>key</a>. An <dfn>index</dfn> allows looking up <a title="record">records</a> in an <a>object store</a>

          </p>
          <p>
            An index is a specialized persistent key-value storage and has a <dfn>referenced</dfn> <a>object store</a>.
            The index has a <dfn title="index record list">list of records</dfn> which hold the
            data stored in the index. The records in an index are automatically populated whenever records in the
            <a>referenced</a> object store are inserted, updated or deleted. There can be several <a title="index">indexes</a>
            referencing the same <a>object store</a>, in which changes to the object store cause all such indexes
            to get updated.
          </p>
          <p>
            The values in the index's <a title="record">records</a> are always values of <a title="key">keys</a> in the index's <a>referenced</a>
            object store. The keys are derived from the referenced object store's <a title="value">values</a> using a <dfn title="index key path"><a>key path</a></dfn>.
            If a given <a>record</a> with key <var>X</var> in the object store referenced by the index has the value <var>A</var>, and
            <a title="evaluate key path">evaluating</a> the <a title="index key path">index's key path</a> on <var>A</var> yields the result
            <var>Y</var>, then the index will contain a record with key <var>Y</var> and value <var>X</var>.
          </p>
          <aside class="example">
              For example, if an index's <a>referenced</a> object store contains a record with the key <code>123</code>

              is <code>"first"</code> then the index would contain a record with the key <code>"Alice"</code> and the value <code>123</code>.
          </aside>
          <p>
            Records in an index are said to have a <dfn>referenced value</dfn>. This is the value of the record in the index's referenced
            object store which has a key equal to the index's record's value. So in the example above,
            the record in the index whose key is <var>Y</var> and value is <var>X</var> has a <a>referenced value</a> of <var>A</var>.

            Each record in an index references one and only one record in the index's <a>referenced</a> object store. However there can be

            which reference a given record in an object store.

          <p>
            The <a title="record">records</a> in an index are always sorted according to the <a title="record">record's</a> key. However unlike object stores,
            a given index can contain multiple records with the same key. Such records are additionally sorted according to
            the <a title="index">index's</a> <a title="record">record's</a> value (meaning the key of the record in the referenced <a>object store</a>).

          </p>
          <p>
            Each index also has a <dfn>unique</dfn> flag. When this flag is set to true, the index enforces that no two <a title="record">records</a>

            modified such that evaluating the index's key path on the records new value yields a result which already exists in the

          </p>
          <p>
            Each index also has a <dfn>multiEntry</dfn> flag. This flag affects how the index behaves when the result of evaluating
            the index's <a title="index key path">key path</a> yields an <code>Array</code>. If the <a>multiEntry</a> flag is false, then
            a single <a>record</a> whose <a>key</a> is an <code>Array</code> is added to the index. If the <a>multiEntry</a> flag is
            true, then the one <a>record</a> is added to the index for each item in the <code>Array</code>. The <a>key</a> for each

            have an <dfn>active</dfn> flag, which determines if new <a title="request">requests</a> can be made
            against the transaction. Finally, transactions also contain a <dfn>request list</dfn> of
            <a title="request">requests</a> which have been made against the transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each transaction has a fixed scope, determined when the transaction is created.
            A transaction's scope remains fixed for the lifetime of that transaction.

          <p>
            <a title="transaction">Transactions</a> offer some protection from
            application and system failures. A <a>transaction</a> may be used to
            store multiple data records or to conditionally modify certain data
            records. A <a>transaction</a> represents an atomic and durable set
            of data access and data mutation operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a title="transaction">Transactions</a> are expected to be short lived. This is encouraged
            by the <a title="transaction commit">automatic committing</a> functionality described below. Authors can still cause
            transactions to run for a long time; however, this usage pattern
            is not generally recommended as it can lead to a bad user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <dfn title="transaction lifetime">lifetime</dfn> of a <a>transaction</a> is as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A transaction is <dfn title="transaction create">created</dfn> using
              <a href="#widl-IDBDatabase-transaction-IDBTransaction-DOMString-sequence-DOMString--storeNames-IDBTransactionMode-mode"><code>IDBDatabase.transaction</code></a>.
              The arguments passed determine the <a>scope</a> of the transaction and whether the transaction is read-only.
              When a transaction is created its <a>active</a> flag is initially set to true.
            </li>
            <li>
              The implementation MUST allow <a title="request">requests</a> to be <a title="place request">placed</a> against the transaction
              whenever the <a>active</a> flag is true. This is the case even if the transaction has not yet been
              <a title="transaction start">started</a>. Until the transaction is <a title="transaction start">started</a>
              the implementation MUST NOT execute these requests; however, the implementation MUST keep track of the
              <a title="request">requests</a> and their order. Requests may be placed against a transaction only while that transaction
              is <a>active</a>. If an attempt is made to place a request against a transaction when that transaction is not
              <a>active</a>, the implementation MUST reject the attempt by
              throwing a <code>DOMException</code> of type <a><code>TransactionInactiveError</code></a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once an implementation is able to enforce the constraints defined for the transaction <a>mode</a>, defined below,
              the implementation MUST queue up an operation to <dfn title="transaction start">start</dfn> the transaction asynchronously.
              The timing for when this happens is affected by:
                <ul>
                  <li>The <a>mode</a> in which the transaction is opened.</li>
                  <li>Which <a title="object store">object stores</a> are included in the <a>scope</a> of the transaction.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the transaction has been <a title="transaction start">started</a> the implementation can
              start executing the <a title="request">requests</a> placed against the transaction. Unless otherwise defined, requests
              MUST be executed in the order in which they were made against the transaction. Likewise, their results MUST
              be returned in the order the requests were placed against a specific transaction.
              There is no guarantee about the order that results from requests in different transactions are returned.
              Similarly, the transaction <a title="mode">modes</a> ensure that two requests placed against different transactions
              can execute in any order without affecting what resulting data is stored in the database.
            </li>
            <li>
              A transaction can be <dfn title="transaction abort">aborted</dfn> at any time before it is <a title="transaction finish">finished</a>,
              even if the transaction isn't currently <a>active</a> or hasn't yet <a title="transaction start">started</a>.
              When a transaction is aborted the implementation MUST undo (roll back) any changes
              that were made to the <a>database</a> during that transaction. This includes both changes to the contents of
              <a title="object store">object stores</a> as well as additions and removals of <a title="object store">object stores</a> and <a title="index">indexes</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              A transaction can fail for reasons not tied to a particular <a>IDBRequest</a>. For example due to IO errors
              when committing the transaction, or due to running into a quota limit where the implementation can't tie
              exceeding the quota to a partcular request. In this case the implementation MUST run the
              <a>steps for aborting a transaction</a> using the transaction as <var>transaction</var> and the appropriate
              error type as <var>error</var>. For example if quota was exceeded then <code>QuotaExceededError</code> should
              be used as <var>error</var>, and if an IO error happened, <code>UnknownError</code> should be used as
              <var>error</var>.
            </li>
            <li>
              When a transaction can no longer become <a>active</a>, the implementation MUST attempt to
              <dfn title="transaction commit">commit</dfn> it, as long as the transaction has not been <a title="transaction abort">aborted</a>.
              This usually happens after all requests placed against the
              transaction have been executed and their returned results handled, and no new requests have been placed
              against the transaction. When a transaction is committed, the implementation MUST atomically write
              any changes to the <a>database</a> made by requests placed against the transaction. That is, either all
              of the changes MUST be written, or if an error occurs, such as a disk write error, the implementation
              MUST NOT write any of the changes to the database. If such an error occurs, the implementation MUST
              <a title="transaction abort">abort</a> the transaction by following the <a>steps for aborting a transaction</a>, otherwise it
              MUST <a title="transaction commit">commit</a> the transaction by following the <a>steps for committing a transaction</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              When a transaction is <a title="transaction commit">committed</a> or <a title="transaction abort">aborted</a>, it is said to be
              <dfn title="transaction finish">finished</dfn>. If a transaction can't be finished, for example
              due to the implementation crashing or the user taking some explicit action to cancel it, the
              implementation MUST <a title="transaction abort">abort</a> the transaction.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Transactions are opened in one of three <dfn title="mode">modes</dfn>. The mode
            determines how concurrent access to <a title="object store">object stores</a> in the transaction are isolated.

                A <dfn title="transaction readonly"><code>"readonly"</code></dfn> transaction is only allowed
                to read data. No modifications can be done by this type of transaction. This has the advantage
                that several <code>"readonly"</code> transactions can run at the same time even if their <a title="scope">scopes</a>
                are overlapping, i.e. if they are using the same object stores. This type of transaction can
                be created any time once a database has been opened using the
                <a href="#widl-IDBDatabase-transaction-IDBTransaction-DOMString-sequence-DOMString--storeNames-IDBTransactionMode-mode"><code>IDBDatabase.transaction</code></a>

            <dd>
                A <dfn title="transaction readwrite"><code>"readwrite"</code></dfn> transaction is allowed to read, modify and
                delete data from existing object stores. However object stores and indexes can't be added or removed.
                Multiple <code>"readwrite"</code> transactions can't run at the same time if their <a title="scope">scopes</a> are overlapping
                since that would mean that they can modify each other's data in the middle of the transaction.
                This type of transaction can be created any time once a database has been opened using the
                <a href="#widl-IDBDatabase-transaction-IDBTransaction-DOMString-sequence-DOMString--storeNames-IDBTransactionMode-mode"><code>IDBDatabase.transaction</code></a>

            <dt>versionchange</dt>
            <dd>
                A <dfn title="transaction versionchange"><code>"versionchange"</code></dfn> transaction is similar to a <code>"readwrite"</code> transaction,
                however it can additionally create and remove object stores and indexes. It is the only type of
                transaction that can do so. This type of transaction can't be manually created, but instead is created
                automatically when a <a><code>upgradeneeded</code></a> event is fired.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <p>
            Any number of transactions opened in <a title="transaction readonly"><code>"readonly"</code></a> mode are allowed to run concurrently,
            even if the transaction's <a>scope</a> overlap and include the same <a title="object store">object stores</a>.
            As long as a <code>"readonly"</code> transaction is running, the data that the implementation returns
            through <a title="request">requests</a> created with that transaction MUST remain
            constant. That is, two requests to read the same piece of data MUST yield the same result
            both for the case when data is found and the result is that data, and for the case when data
            is not found and a lack of data is indicated.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a number of ways that an implementation ensures this. The implementation can prevent any
            <code>"readwrite"</code> transaction, whose scope overlaps the scope of the <code>"readonly"</code> transaction, from
            starting until the <code>"readonly"</code> transaction finishes. Or the implementation can allow the <code>"readonly"</code>
            transaction to see a snapshot of the contents of the <a title="object store">object stores</a> which is taken when
            the <code>"readonly"</code> transaction started.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, implementations MUST ensure that a <code>"readwrite"</code> transaction is only affected by
            changes to <a title="object store">object stores</a> that are made using the transaction itself. For example, the
            implementation MUST ensure that another transaction does not modify the contents of
            <a title="object store">object stores</a> in the <code>"readwrite"</code> transaction's <a>scope</a>. The implementation
            MUST also ensure that if the <code>"readwrite"</code> transaction completes successfully, the
            changes written to <a title="object store">object stores</a> using the transaction can be committed to the
            <a>database</a> without merge conflicts. An implementation MUST NOT abort a transaction
            due to merge conflicts.
          </p>
          <p>
            If multiple <code>"readwrite"</code> transactions are attempting to access the same object store (i.e.
            if they have overlapping <a>scope</a>), the transaction that was <a title="transaction create">
            created</a> first MUST be the transaction which gets access to the object store first. Due to
            the requirements in the previous paragraph, this also means that it is the only transaction
            which has access to the object store until the transaction is <a title="transaction finish">finished</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Any transaction
            <a title="transaction create">created</a> after a
            <code>"readwrite"</code> transaction MUST see the changes
            written by the <code>"readwrite"</code> transaction. So if
            a
            <code>"readwrite"</code> transaction, A, is created, and
            later another transaction B, is created, and the two
            transactions have overlapping
            <a title="scope">scopes</a>, then B MUST see any changes
            made to any <a title="object store">object stores</a> that
            are part of that overlapping <a>scope</a>. Due to the
            requirements in the previous paragraph, this also means
            that the B transaction does not have access to any
            <a title="object store">object stores</a> in that
            overlapping <a>scope</a> until the A transaction
            is <a title="transaction finish">finished</a>.
          </p>

          <p class="note">
            Generally speaking, the above requirements mean that any
            transaction which has an overlapping scope with a
            <code>"readwrite"</code> transaction and which was created
            after that
            <code>"readwrite"</code> transaction, can't run in
            parallel with that
            <code>"readwrite"</code> transaction.
          </p>

          <p>
            A <code>"versionchange"</code> transaction never run concurrently with other transactions.
            When a database is opened with a <a>version</a> number higher than the current <a>version</a>, a new
            <code>"versionchange"</code> transaction is automatically created and made available through the
            <a><code>upgradeneeded</code></a> event. The <a><code>upgradeneeded</code></a> event isn't fired, and thus the
            <code>"versionchange"</code> transaction isn't started, until all other <a title="connection">connections</a> to the same
            <a>database</a> are closed. This ensures that all other transactions are <a title="transaction finish">finished</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            As long as a <code>"versionchange"</code> transaction
            is running, attempts to open more <a title="connection">connections</a> to the same <a>database</a> are delayed,
            and any attempts to use the same <a>connection</a> to start additional transactions will result in
            an exception being thrown. Thus <code>"versionchange"</code> transactions not only ensure that
            no other transactions are running concurrently, but also ensure that no other transactions are queued
            against the same <a>database</a> as long as the transaction is running.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
          	<code>"versionchange"</code> transaction is automatically created
          	when a database version number is provided that is greater than the current database version.
          	This <a>transaction</a> will be active inside the <a><code>upgradeneeded</code></a> event handler,
          	allowing the creation of new <a title="object store">object stores</a> and <a title="index">indexes</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            User agents MUST ensure a reasonable level of fairness across transactions to prevent
            starvation. For example, if multiple <code>"readonly"</code> transactions are started one after another
            the implementation MUST NOT indefinitely prevent a pending <code>"readwrite"</code>
            transaction from <a title="transaction start">starting</a>.

          <h4>Cursor</h4>
          <p>
            <a title="cursor">Cursors</a> are a transient mechanism used to
            iterate over multiple records in a database.
            Storage operations are performed on the underlying <a>index</a> or an
            <a>object store</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <dfn>cursor</dfn> comprises a <dfn>range</dfn> of records in either an <a>index</a>
            or an <a>object store</a>. The cursor has a <dfn title="cursor source">source</dfn> that indicates
            which index or object store is associated with the records over which the <a>cursor</a> is iterating.
            A <a>cursor</a> maintains a <dfn>position</dfn> over
            this series, which moves in a <dfn>direction</dfn> that is in either
            monotonically increasing or decreasing order of the <a>record</a> keys. Cursors
            also have a <dfn title="cursor key">key</dfn> and a <dfn title="cursor value">value</dfn>
            which represent the <a>key</a> and the <a>value</a> of the last iterated <a>record</a>.
            Cursors finally have a <dfn>got value</dfn> flag. When this flag is false, the cursor is either
            in the process of loading the next value or it has reached the end of its <a>range</a>, when it
            is true, it indicates that the cursor is currently holding a value and that it is ready to iterate
            to the next one.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are four possible values for a cursor's <a>direction</a>. The direction of a cursor determines
            if the cursor initial position is at the start of its <a title="cursor source">source</a> or at its end.
            It also determines in which direction the cursor moves when iterated, and if it skips duplicated values
            when iterating indexes. The allowed values for a cursor's <a>direction</a> is as follows:
          </p>
          <dl class="idl" title="enum IDBCursorDirection">
            <dt>next</dt>
            <dd>This direction causes the cursor to be opened at the start of the
            <a title="cursor source">source</a>. When iterated, the <a>cursor</a> should yield all records, including
            duplicates, in monotonically increasing order of keys.</dd>

            <dt>nextunique</dt>
            <dd>This direction causes the cursor to be opened at the start of the
            <a title="cursor source">source</a>. When iterated, the <a>cursor</a> should not yield records with
            the same key, but otherwise yield all records, in monotonically increasing order of keys. For every key
            with duplicate values, only the first record is yielded. When the <a title="cursor source">source</a> is
            an <a>object store</a> or a <a>unique</a> <a>index</a>, this direction has the exact same behavior as <code>"next"</code>.</dd>
            <dt>prev</dt>
            <dd>This direction causes the cursor to be opened at the end of the
            <a title="cursor source">source</a>. When iterated, the <a>cursor</a> should yield all records, including
            duplicates, in monotonically decreasing order of keys.</dd>

            <dt>prevunique</dt>
            <dd>This direction causes the cursor to be opened at the end of the
            <a title="cursor source">source</a>. When iterated, the <a>cursor</a> should not yield records with
            the same key, but otherwise yield all records, in monotonically decreasing order of keys. For every key
            with duplicate values, only the first record is yielded. When the <a title="cursor source">source</a> is
            an <a>object store</a> or a <a>unique</a> <a>index</a>, this direction has the exact same behavior as <code>"prev"</code>.</dd>
          </dl>
          <p>
            If the <a title="cursor source">source</a> of a cursor is an <a>object store</a>, the <dfn>effective object store</dfn>
            of the cursor is that object store and the <dfn>effective key</dfn> of the cursor is the cursor's <a>position</a>.
            If the <a title="cursor source">source</a> of a cursor is an <a>index</a>, the <a>effective object store</a>
            of the cursor is that index's <a>referenced</a> object store and the <a>effective key</a> is the cursor's
            <a>object store position</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is possible for the list of records which the cursor is iterating over to
            change before the full <a>range</a> of the cursor has been iterated. In order to
            handle this, cursors maintain their <a>position</a> not as an index, but rather
            as a <a>key</a> of the previously returned record. For a forward iterating cursor,
            the next time the cursor is asked to iterate to the next record it returns the
            record with the lowest <a>key</a> <a>greater than</a> the one previously returned. For
            a backwards iterating cursor, the situation is opposite and it returns the record
            with the highest <a>key</a> <a>less than</a> the one previously returned.
          </p>
          <p>
            For cursors iterating indexes the situation is a little bit more complicated since
            multiple records can have the same key and are therefore also sorted by <a>value</a>.
            When iterating indexes the <a>cursor</a> also has an <dfn>object store position</dfn>, which indicates
            the <a>value</a> of the previously found <a>record</a> in the index. Both
            <a>position</a> and the <a>object store position</a> are used when finding the next appropriate record.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a title="cursor">Cursor</a> objects implement the <a>IDBCursor</a>
            interfaces. There is only ever one
            <a>IDBCursor</a>
            instance representing
            a given <a>cursor</a>. However there is no limit on how many cursors can be used at the
            same time.

          <h4>Key Generators</h4>
          <p>
            When a <a>object store</a> is created it can be specified to use a <dfn>key generator</dfn>.
            A <a>key generator</a> keeps an internal <dfn>current number</dfn>. The <a>current number</a>
            is always a positive integer. Whenever the key generator is used to generate a new <a>key</a>, the
            generator's <a>current number</a> is returned and <strong>then</strong> incremented to prepare
            for the next time a new <a>key</a> is needed. Implementations MUST use the following rules
            for generating numbers when a <a>key generator</a> is used.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Every object store that uses key generators use a separate generator. I.e. interacting with one
              object store never affects the key generator of any other object store.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <a>current number</a> of a <a>key generator</a> is always set to <code>1</code> when the
              <a>object store</a> for that key generator is first created.
            </li>
            <li>
              When a key generator is used to generate a new <a>key</a> for a <a>object store</a>, the
              key generator's <a>current number</a> is used as the new key value and then the
              key generator's <a>current number</a> is increased by <code>1</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                When a <a>record</a> is stored and an key value is specified in the call to store the record,
                if the specified key value is a <code>Number</code> greater than or equal to the key generator's
                <a>current number</a>, then the key generator's <a>current number</a> is set to the smallest integer
                number <a>greater than</a> the explicit key.
                A key can be specified both for object stores which use <a>in-line keys</a>, by setting the
                property on the stored value which the <a title="object store key path">object store's key path</a>
                points to, and for object stores which use <a>out-of-line keys</a>, by passing a key argument
                to the call to store the <a>record</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Only specified keys values which
                are <code>Number</code> values affect the <a>current number</a> of the key generator.
                <code>Date</code>s and <code>Array</code>s which contain <code>Number</code>s do not affect
                the <a>current number</a> of the key generator. Nor do <code>DOMString</code> values which
                could be parsed as numbers. Negative <code>Number</code>s
                do not affect the <a>current number</a> since they are always lower than the <a>current
                number</a>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Modifying a key generator's <a>current number</a> is considered part of a database operation.
              This means that if the operation fails and the operation is reverted, the <a>current number</a>
              is reverted to the value it had before the operation started. This applies both to modifications
              that happen due to the <a>current number</a> getting increased by <code>1</code> when the key
              generator is used, and to modifications that happen due to a <a>record</a> being stored with a
              key value specified in the call to store the <a>record</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Likewise, if a <a>transaction</a> is aborted, the <a>current number</a> of the key generator's
              for all <a title="object store">object stores</a> in the transaction's <a>scope</a> is reverted to the values they
              had before the <a>transaction</a> was started.
            </li>
            <li>
              When the <a>current number</a> of a key generator reaches above the value <code>2^53</code>
              (<code>9007199254740992</code>) any attempts to use the key generator to generate a new
              <a>key</a> will result in a <code>ConstraintError</code>.
              It is still possible to insert <a title="record">records</a> into the
              object store by specifying an explicit key, however the only way to use a key generator
              again for the object store is to delete the object store and create a new one.
              <p class="note">
                As long as key generators are used in a normal fashion this will not be a problem.
                If you generate a new key 1000 times per second day and night, you won't run into this limit
                for over 285000 years.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              The <a>current number</a> for a key generator never decreases, other than as a result of
              database operations being reverted. Deleting a <a>record</a> from an <a>object store</a>
              never affects the object store's key generator. Even clearing all records from an
              object store, for example using the
              <a href="#widl-IDBObjectStore-clear-IDBRequest"><code>clear()</code></a> function, does
              not affect the <a>current number</a> of the object store's key generator.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A practical result of this is that the first key generated for an object store is always <code>1</code>
            (unless a higher numeric key is inserted first) and the key generated for an object store is always a
            positive integer higher than the highest numeric key in the store. The same key is never generated
            twice for the same object store unless a transaction is rolled back.
          </p>
          <aside class="example">
            <p>Each object store gets its own key generator:</p>

            </pre>

            <p>Inserting an item with an explicit key affects the key generator if,
            and only if, the key is numeric and higher than the last generated
            key.</p>

                In some implementations it is possible for the implementation to run into problems
                after queuing up an operation to create the <a>object store</a> after the <code>createObjectStore</code> function has returned.
                For example in implementations where metadata about the newly created <a title="object store">objectStore</a> is inserted into the database asynchronously,
                or where the implementation might need to ask the user for permission for quota reasons.
                Such implementations MUST still create and return an <a>IDBObjectStore</a> object. Instead,
                once the implementation realizes that creating the <a title="object store">objectStore</a> has failed, it MUST abort the transaction
                using the <a>steps for aborting a transaction</a> using the appropriate error as <var>error</var> parameter. For example if
                creating the <a>object store</a> failed due to quota reasons, <code>QuotaError</code> MUST be used as error.

              <p>
                Otherwise, the implementation MUST create a new <a>index</a> in the <a>object store</a> and return an <a>IDBIndex</a> object representing it.
                Set the created <a>index</a>'s <a title="index name">name</a> to <var>name</var> and <a title="index key path">key path</a> to <var>keyPath</var>.
                Set the created <a>index</a>'s <a>unique</a> and <a>multiEntry</a> flags to the values of the

              <p>
                The index that is requested to be created can contain constraints on the data allowed in the index's
                <a>referenced</a> object store, such as requiring uniqueness of the values referenced by the
                index's keyPath. If the <a>referenced</a> object store already contains data which violates these
                constraints, this MUST NOT cause the implementation of createIndex to throw an exception or affect what it returns.
                The implementation MUST still create and return an <a>IDBIndex</a> object.
                Instead the implementation must queue up an operation to abort the <a title="transaction versionchange"><code>"versionchange"</code></a> transaction
                which was used for the createIndex call.
              </p>

                This method synchronously modifies the
                <a href="#widl-IDBObjectStore-indexNames"><code>IDBObjectStore.indexNames</code></a> property.
                However it only changes the <a href="#widl-IDBObjectStore-indexNames"><code>IDBObjectStore.indexNames</code></a>
                property on the <a>IDBObjectStore</a> instance on which it was called.
                Although this method does not return a <a>IDBRequest</a> object, the index creation itself is
                processed as an asynchronous request within the <a title="transaction versionchange"><code>"versionchange"</code></a> transaction.
              </p>
              <p>
                In some implementations it is possible for the implementation to asynchronously run into problems
                creating the index after the createIndex function has returned.
                For example in implementations where metadata about the newly created index is
                queued up to be inserted into the database asynchronously,
                or where the implementation might need to ask the user for permission for quota reasons.
                Such implementations MUST still create and return an <a>IDBIndex</a> object. Instead,
                once the implementation realizes that creating the index has failed, it MUST abort the transaction
                using the <a>steps for aborting a transaction</a> using the appropriate error as <var>error</var> parameter. For example if
                creating the <a>index</a> failed due to quota reasons, <code>QuotaError</code> MUST be used as error and if the index
                can't be created due to <a>unique</a> constraints, <code>ConstraintError</code> MUST be used as error.

                      creation is considered an asynchronous <a>request</a>, the index's <a title="unique">uniqueness</a>
                      constraint does not cause the second <a>request</a> to fail. Instead, the <a>transaction</a> will be

                on the request is set to false before the request is returned.  The steps are run with the cursor's

            The <dfn>steps for opening a database</dfn> are defined in the following steps. The algorithm in these steps
            takes four arguments:
            the <var>origin</var> which requested the <a>database</a> to be opened,

              If <var>db</var> was found in previous step, wait until the following conditions are all fulfilled:

        <h3>User tracking</h3>

        <p>
          A third-party host (or any object capable of getting content
          distributed to multiple sites) could use a unique identifier
          stored in its client-side database to track a user across multiple
          sessions, building a profile of the user's activities. In conjunction
          with a site that is aware of the user's real id object (for
          example an e-commerce site that requires authenticated credentials),
          this could allow oppressive groups to target individuals with
          greater accuracy than in a world with purely anonymous Web usage.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are a number of techniques that can be used to mitigate the
          risk of user tracking:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Blocking third-party storage</dt>
          <dd>
            User agents MAY restrict access to the database objects
            to scripts originating at the domain of the top-level document of
            the <span>browsing context</span>, for instance denying access to
            the API for pages from other domains running in <code>iframe</code>s.
          </dd>

          <dt>Expiring stored data</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>User agents MAY automatically delete stored data after a period
            of time.</p>

            <p>This can restrict the ability of a site to track a user, as the
            site would then only be able to track the user across multiple
            sessions when he authenticates with the site itself (e.g. by
            making a purchase or logging in to a service).</p>

            <p>However, this also puts the user's data at risk.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Treating persistent storage as cookies</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>User agents should present the database feature
            to the user in a way that associates them strongly with HTTP
            session cookies. [[COOKIES]]</p>

            <p>This might encourage users to view such storage with healthy
            suspicion.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Site-specific white-listing of access to databases</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>User agents MAY require the user to authorize access to
            databases before a site can use the feature.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Origin-tracking of stored data</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>User agents MAY record the <span title="origin">origins</span>
            of sites that contained content from third-party origins that
            caused data to be stored.</p>

            <p>If this information is then used to present the view of data
            currently in persistent storage, it would allow the user to make
            informed decisions about which parts of the persistent storage to
            prune. Combined with a blacklist ("delete this data and prevent
            this domain from ever storing data again"), the user can restrict
            the use of persistent storage to sites that he trusts.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Shared blacklists</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>User agents MAY allow users to share their persistent storage
            domain blacklists.</p>

            <p>This would allow communities to act together to protect their
            privacy.</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
          While these suggestions prevent trivial use of this API for user
          tracking, they do not block it altogether. Within a single domain, a
          site can continue to track the user during a session, and can then
          pass all this information to the third party along with any
          identifying information (names, credit card numbers, addresses)
          obtained by the site. If a third party cooperates with multiple
          sites to obtain such information, a profile can still be
          created.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, user tracking is to some extent possible even with no
          cooperation from the user agent whatsoever, for instance by using
          session identifiers in URLs, a technique already commonly used for
          innocuous purposes but easily repurposed for user tracking (even
          retroactively). This information can then be shared with other
          sites, using using visitors' IP addresses and other user-specific
          data (e.g. user-agent headers and configuration settings) to combine
          separate sessions into coherent user profiles.

        <h3>Cookie resurrection</h3>

        <p>
          If the user interface for persistent storage presents data in the
          persistent storage features described in this specification
          separately from data in HTTP session cookies, then users are likely
          to delete data in one and not the other. This would allow sites to
          use the two features as redundant backup for each other, defeating a
          user's attempts to protect his privacy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="sensitivity-of-data" class="section">
        <h3>Sensitivity of data</h3>

        <p>
          User agents should treat persistently stored data as potentially
          sensitive; it is quite possible for e-mails, calendar appointments,
          health records, or other confidential documents to be stored in this
          mechanism.
        </p>

        <p>To this end, user agents should ensure that when deleting data,
          it is promptly deleted from the underlying storage.

        <h3>DNS spoofing attacks</h3>

        <p>
          Because of the potential for DNS spoofing attacks, one cannot
          guarantee that a host claiming to be in a certain domain really is
          from that domain. To mitigate this, pages can use SSL. Pages using
          SSL can be sure that only pages using SSL that have certificates
          identifying them as being from the same domain can access their
          databases.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="cross-directory-attacks" class="section">
        <h3>Cross-directory attacks</h3>

        <p>
          Different authors sharing one host name, for example users
          hosting content on <code>geocities.com</code>, all share one
          set of databases.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is no feature to restrict the access by pathname. Authors on
          shared hosts are therefore recommended to avoid using these
          features, as it would be trivial for other authors to read the data
          and overwrite it.
        </p>

        <p class="note">Even if a path-restriction feature was made
          available, the usual DOM scripting security model would make it
          trivial to bypass this protection and access the data from any
          path.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="implementation-risks" class="section">
        <h3>Implementation risks</h3>

        <p>The two primary risks when implementing these persistent storage
        features are letting hostile sites read information from other
        domains, and letting hostile sites write information that is then
        read from other domains.</p>

        <p>Letting third-party sites read data that is not supposed to be
        read from their domain causes <em>information leakage</em>, For
        example, a user's shopping wish list on one domain could be used by
        another domain for targeted advertising; or a user's
        work-in-progress confidential documents stored by a word-processing
        site could be examined by the site of a competing company.</p>

        <p>Letting third-party sites write data to the persistent storage of
        other domains can result in <em>information spoofing</em>, which is
        equally dangerous. For example, a hostile site could add records to a
        user's wish list; or a hostile site could set a user's session
        identifier to a known ID that the hostile site can then use to track
        the user's actions on the victim site.</p>

        <p>Thus, strictly following the <span>origin</span> model described
        in this specification is important for user security.</p>
