<h1>Appendix J: Minimizing SVG File Sizes</h1>

<p class="normativity"><em>This appendix is informative, not normative.</em></p>

    <p>Considerable effort has been made to make SVG file sizes as
    small as possible while still retaining the benefits of XML and
    achieving compatibility and leverage with other W3C
    specifications.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the features in SVG that promote small file
    sizes:</p>
    <ul><li>SVG's path data definition was defined to produce a
      compact data stream for vector graphics data: all commands
      are one character in length; relative coordinates are
      available; separator characters do not have to be supplied
      when tokens can be identified implicitly; smooth curve
      formulations are available (cubic Béziers, quadratic
      Béziers and elliptical arcs) to prevent the need to
      tesselate into polylines; and shortcut formulations exist for
      common forms of cubic Bézier segments, quadratic
      Bézier segments, and horizontal and vertical straight
      line segments so that the minimum number of coordinates need
      to be specified.</li><li>Text can be specified using XML character data — no need
      to convert to outlines.</li><li>SVG contains a facility for defining symbols once and
      referencing them multiple times using different visual
      attributes and different sizing, positioning, clipping and
      client-side filter effects</li><li>User agents that support <a href="styling.html#StylingWithCSS">styling with CSS</a> can
      use CSS selectors and property inheritance to define commonly
      used sets of attributes once as named styles.</li><li>Filter effects allow for compelling visual results and
      effects typically found only in image-authoring tools using
      small amounts of vector and/or raster data</li></ul>
    <p>Additionally, HTTP/1.1 allows for compressed data to be
    passed from server to client, which can result in significant
    file size reduction. Here are some sample compression results
    using <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt">gzip
    compression</a> on SVG documents [<a href="refs.html#ref-RFC1952">RFC1952</a>]:</p>
    <table class="vert" summary="gzip compression results on SVG file sizes"><tr style="text-align: center"><th>Uncompressed
         SVG</th><th>With gzip
         compression</th><th>Compression
         ratio</th></tr><tr style="text-align: right"><td>12,912</td><td>2,463</td><td>81%</td></tr><tr style="text-align: right"><td>12,164</td><td>2,553</td><td>79%</td></tr><tr style="text-align: right"><td>11,613</td><td>2,617</td><td>77%</td></tr><tr style="text-align: right"><td>18,689</td><td>4,077</td><td>78%</td></tr><tr style="text-align: right"><td>13,024</td><td>2,041</td><td>84%</td></tr></table>
    <p>A related issue is progressive rendering. Some SVG viewers
    will support:</p>
    <ul><li>the ability to display the first parts of an SVG document
      fragments as the remainder of the document is downloaded from
      the server; thus, the user will see part of the SVG drawing
      right away and interact with it, even if the SVG file size is
      large.</li><li>delayed downloading of images and fonts. Just like some
      HTML browsers, some SVG viewers will download images and
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-CSS2-20080411/fonts.html#q1">WebFonts</a>
      ([<a href="refs.html#ref-CSS2">CSS2</a>], section 15.1)
      last, substituting a temporary image and system fonts,
      respectively, until the given image and/or font is
      available.</li></ul>
    <p>Here are techniques for minimizing SVG file sizes and
    minimizing the time before the user is able to start
    interacting with the SVG document fragments:</p>
    <ul><li>Construct the SVG file such that any links which the user
      might want to click on are included at the beginning of the
      SVG file</li><li>Use default values whenever possible rather than defining
      all attributes and properties explicitly.</li><li>Take advantage of the <a href="paths.html#PathData">path
      data</a> data compaction facilities: use relative
      coordinates; use <em>h</em> and <em>v</em> for horizontal and
      vertical lines; use <em>s</em> or <em>t</em> for cubic and
      quadratic Bézier segments whenever possible; eliminate
      extraneous white space and separators.</li><li>Utilize symbols if the same graphic appears multiple
      times in the document</li><li>For user agents that support <a href="styling.html#StylingWithCSS">styling with CSS</a>,
      utilize CSS property inheritance and selectors to consolidate
      commonly used properties into named styles or to assign the
      properties to a parent <a href="struct.html#GElement"><span class="element-name">‘g’</span></a> element.</li><li>Utilize filter effects to help construct graphics via
      client-side graphics operations.</li></ul>
